<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I loved it! It was great applying what was learned and collaborating with a pair in doing so. It's great seeing the lines of code translate to a visual website and having it resemble the actual website as close as possible ( without the CSS).
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It wasn't that hard! there are so many resources available online other than what was in the instructions. I made use of W3 school's HTML5 semantics to add the <main> tag to properly show the main content of the page.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
By just adding what was required as per instructions. No formatting on HTML but the structure of the website is made through HTML by clearly having a header and body to the website and adding the relevant semantic elements.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
-It allows for structure and to clearly organize content on the website. All tags make sense and the semantic elements all clearly state something about the website and its organization.What's bad mostly has to do with the formatting and layout. It looks pretty bland when it isn't combined with the stylesheets.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I basically start with what's required such as the DOCTYPE, head,title body and closing of all relevant tags. And then I think about the content of the website and the tags that are relevant( it has to make sense!) and take it from there. Seeing as i'm relatively inexperienced with this I try to also see the structure of other websites and their semantic elements and the available resources.
