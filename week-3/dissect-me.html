			<h2>Git and Version Control</h2>
			<h4>Thursday November 12th, 2015</h4>


			<p>
				What are the benefits of version control?
				Before discussing the benefits of version control we should define it beforehand. Version control is a system of tracking that allows any modifications or changes to be traced back to. What this means is simply if any changes are made that could potentially negatively affect a "version" of a project we can return to any previous version before this error or mistake and work from there. The benefits are enormous as it saves time and makes work more efficient. It also avoids work overlap when working and collaborating with others on more complicated projects. Git, the version control we will be discussing in this blog post, is the version control tool used on the website GitHub. It thus allows us to see who made which changes and when and makes work a lot more efficient.

				How does git help you keep track of changes?
				There are three stanges to a change on git. The first,the working stage, is basically the first step when you are working on a file in a directory and making any modifications. This stage is untracked or isn't saved yet. The second stage when you would like to add the modifications before "committing" them or saving them is the "staged". When you are done working and want to save your progress ( just like a checkpoint in a videogame) you then "commit" the last stage of git stages. These three steps allow to ensure modifications are made properly and once saved you can see when the change was made and who made the change as well with a simple "git log" command on the command line.

				Why use GitHub to store your code?
				GitHub is a remote hub. On GitHub you can store your code and collaborate on projects with other developers. This community and "social" coding website is a great haven to store code because it allows others to look at your code before you submit to your master branch ( where all your working code is!) and adds an extra layer of protection. Not too get too much in depth with GitHub lingo, but you do this by making a "Pull request" which basically lets others know that you'd like your code to be reviewed.

			What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
			HTML tags more often specifically with our Blog posts are article and section. HTML5 semantic elements allow for even better structure of the website and organization depending on the content. Considering we'll mostly focus on blog content makes sense to use section tags and article tags.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
HTML is a markup language used to display the elements on the page. The browser follows the structure of the HTML language and display that accordingly. For example, we start off by DOCTYPE html which signals the use of HTML code on the page. We follow-up with the basics of HTML structure such as head(title) and body with respectful opening and closing tags. The content of the page is displayed in the body section of the HTML skeleton.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 
Found that Sublime packs a lot more tools than first thought it did. I also noticed installing package control allows us to download snippets created by other people and we can create our own. It allows us to save a lot of time by accessing these snippets that are pre-programmed. I plan to definitely see what's out there and perhaps create a few snippets to make my life as a dev easier!-->
