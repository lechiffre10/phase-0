##What does puts do?
Puts command returns nil and prints the output in the terminal on a new line ( as opposed to Print which is on the same line)
##What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without any decimal points and a float is a number with decimal points ( eg: 5 is an integer and 5.5 is a float)
##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
When you divide using integer arithmetic the computer will provide an integer answer. For example, if your answer would normally consist of decimals, it will only print an integer answer and will round down to the nearest answer. If you divide using a float, you get a float answer. A simple way of looking at it is by example. Assuming you go to a store and you only have 20$ on you. Let's assume each item costs 15$ in the store, so how many items can you purchase? (20/15) =1.33; the answer is 1. You can't purchase 33% of another item. The principle is the same with Integer arithmetic.

```Ruby

Hours = 24 *365
Decade= (3650 * 24) * 60

puts "#{Hours} Hours in a year"
puts "#{Decade} Minutes in a Decade"

```
