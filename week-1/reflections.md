#1.1 Think About Time
By reading through some of these productivity tips and time management techniques I've decided to discipline myself and schedule my day accordingly. Seeing as I have a lot of free time to work through these challenges I can break down my day and structure it to properly go through the challenges. 
This will start with mindful meditation ( 30mins in the morning) to properly set the tone of the day and allow myself to clear my mind.
I will use the Pomodoro technique to go through my challenges ( 25mins of work 5 mins of break and a recap and review at the end )
Timebox will also be used ( allocating a specific time limit for challenges and seeing if It is properly respected - This will help me gauge my pace and my understanding of the material and reflect on that)
Any additional free time will be used for optional material that I find can help me with my progress
#1.2 The Command Line
The shell is the interface that allows users to provide commands that are sent to the operating system. It uses the command line interface to receive instructions ( commands). The bash is the default shell or command language interpreter
The challenge with going through the material was getting a bit used to the interface as it is not a graphical user interface and applying all of the commands appropriately.

- I was able to use all of the commands in the material in the command line

- I believe the redirection topic in the crash course is perhaps the most important  in the command line. Or as explained in the crash course the ability to change the input and output of files 

pwd shows you where you currently are and which directory you are working on

LS allows you to list everything ( files) in the directory

MV allows you to move files or directories around

CD allows you to change the directory you are working on and navigate through directories

../ is a directory

touch allows you to create an empty file

mkdir allows you make a new directory

less displays the content of a file 

rmdir removes a directory

rm removes a file in the directory

help accesses help in the command linea and provides information about commands
