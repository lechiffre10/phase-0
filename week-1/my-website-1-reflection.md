#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
You will need two things: GitHub and your command line. First, on GitHub you will click on the + sign at the top of the page on the right and select create new repository. You select a name, choose to make it public or private and select a license. Once it is created you will find on the middle right of the page HTTPS clone URL so make sure to copy that. This is where the command line comes into play. Once you've selected the directory you want to clone your repository you type git clone "link" and it will clone it to your local computer.
#Describe what open source means.
Open source software simply means software that can be used freely, modified and distributed. Open source software will contain the source code, which allows people to implement changes, fix things or add new features. 
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source is a great initiative. It doesn't make me nervous or protective. Collaborative efforts through open source allow users to improve on each other's work or add new features and generally create great projects together. I think it also depends on the nature of the project as well, certain projects may require more restrictive use.
#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are crucial to the nature of open source. They clearly establish the liberty with which users can use, modify or distribute the software they are working with. Some licenses may be a bit more restrictive in distribution for example or limit the use to being free ( not selling the software) but some such as the MIT license are less restrictive and allow much more freedom with modification, distribution of software as long as the license is attached.
#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Using the command line to create a new branch, commit changes, and merging as well. Basically the previous challenges tasks were solidified by repeating them in this task as well and taking less time to do so.
#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
All of the resources used were available on the challenge page.
